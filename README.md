# Scripting Library
 Zeus Unite Free Scripting Library for Unity Game Projects.

## Part of Our Assets
 The Scripting Library comes in all our Assets provided in the Package. For this we need to Keep the Folder Structure of this Git Organized towards our Asset Packages.
 
 You can find the ScriptLibrary inside:
 ZeusUnite/ZUData/Scripts/ScriptLibrary
 
 All Scripts are grouped inside the
 namespace UniteScripts
 So you can easily import this into your Project and not receive any Errors with your existing Scripts.
 
 # Free to Use
 You can freely use those Scripts for any of your Projects. You can Change and Extend them as you need to.
